		<!-- TEMPORARY TEXT -->
		<p>An HTML game created by Colton Burdick as his CIS3304 (Advanced Web Design) final project.</p>
		<p>The goal of the game is to simply take good care of your guests.<br>You win when you hold a full hotel for a whole day.<br>You lose if 3 guests leave or your last guest leaves.</p>
		<p>Special guests will not appear on Quiet Mode, but guests will remind you to empty their trash and change their bedheets.<br>Warning: Minimizing the window will slow down the game considerably.<br>Leaving the game running in the background is fine (and encouraged), though.</p>
		<p><div id="credits">Characters are owned by Bandai unless stated otherwise.<br>Sounds were ripped from みんなでたまごっちワールド.<br>All sprites and programming were done by me.</div></p>
